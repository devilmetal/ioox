IOOX - Bachelor project
========================

<p>Domaine:            <b>Informatic</b><br/>

<h2>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>The project objective is to develop a pilot Web application that illustrates the benefits to be taken from a unified approach to deal with both data and document oriented information. It relies on the use of standard based XML (eXtended Markup Language) and the associated languages/technologies to address the following issues in an integrated way :</p>
<ul>
<li>modeling of information (use of XML Schema)</li>
<li>storing of information (use of a native XML database)</li>
<li>querying of information (use of Xquery language)</li>
<li>providing Web browser users’ views (use of XSLT language)</li>
<li>interaction with users (use of an open source JavaScript library – AXEL - to author both document and data oriented information, constrained by a model)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequesites/conditions</h3>
<ul style="type:ennumerate;">
<li>The project requires the mastering of several XML associated languages (taugth in the Web Document Engineering course)</li>
<li>Due to the number of languages to be mastered and the volume of work to be performed to achieve the goal, two students are required for this Bachelor project</li>
<h2>WORK DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The proposed pilot application relates to the implementation of a Web application targeted to students and professors of a high school institution in order to share course resources and organize their respective work about taught courses and associated activities. It aims, for example, at providing the following functionalities :</p>
<h4>For the professors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide global information about the course such as course description, details about the examination process, deadlines, etc.</li>
<li>Upload course resources (slides, links, etc.)</li>
<li>Upload interactive quizzes for the preparation of an exam</li>
<li>Provide feedback to students</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the students</h4>
<li>Provide a calendar-based view that facilitates the organization of the student work (editing, for example, a to-do list)</li>
<li>Provide an easy access to resources of a course</li>
<li>Provide an authoring functionality to take notes about a course session and aggregates the content of a given course in the purpose of preparing an exam.</li>
